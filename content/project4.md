### YouTube Video Classifier, Duke University
**Duration:** Oct 2023 - Dec 2023

This project aimed at boosting targeted advertising efficiency by automating the categorization of YouTube videos into music or sports categories. We achieved remarkable success with:

1. **Classification Accuracy:** Utilizing over 60,000 video tag records, we applied classification algorithms and attained more than 96% testing accuracy using both raw count and TF-IDF embedding techniques in the Naive Bayes model, and over 89.57% testing accuracy with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model.

### Nutrition Guide Web App, Duke University
**Duration:** Oct 2023 - Dec 2023

Developed "Nutrition Guide," a dynamic web application microservice, this project interfaced seamlessly with the Databricks data pipeline. Key accomplishments include:

1. **Technology Integration:** Utilized Docker for containerization, along with Azure App Services and Flask for efficient deployment and management.
   
2. **Data Processing Optimization:** Enhanced Databricks ETL-Query pipelines with PySpark and Databricks-SQL, and utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for in-depth data visualization and analysis.
   
3. **Performance and Workflow Improvements:** Conducted load testing to ensure stability under heavy loads and streamlined CI/CD processes with GitHub Actions, significantly reducing deployment errors and accelerating deployment times.

### Stack Overflow Developer Salary Prediction & Satisfaction Analysis, Duke University
**Duration:** Oct 2023 - Dec 2023

This project focused on the deployment of R models to predict compensation and analyze job satisfaction among software engineers, using a dataset of responses from 89,184 participants across 185 countries in 2023. Key methodologies included multilinear and ordinal regression techniques. The study revealed significant findings:

1. **Impact of Organizational Size:** It was found that engineers at smaller companies (2-9 employees) are 2.35 times more likely to report job satisfaction than those in larger organizations, underscoring the influence of company size on employee well-being.
   
2. **Salary Influencing Factors:** The research provided detailed insights into the various elements affecting tech sector salaries, offering valuable guidance for stakeholders in making educated compensation decisions.

### Opioids Control Policy Analysis, Duke University
**Duration:** Oct 2023 - Dec 2023

This project critically evaluated the efficacy of opioid management strategies in various states, concentrating on the implementation within Florida. The comparative analysis included Texas and Washington, utilizing Pre-Post and Difference-in-Differences methodologies, complemented by the analysis of socioeconomic indicators to select control states, encompassing:

1. **Data Processing:** Over 6GB of data from mortality records, DEA pill shipments, and NHGIS population figures for 2006-2015 were meticulously cleaned, merged, and analyzed using Python, providing a comprehensive overview of opioid-related trends.
   
2. **Policy Effectiveness:** The findings underscored the success of Florida's comprehensive approach to opioid regulation and highlighted the critical role of policy in managing public health crises.

### LLM Text Generator, Duke University
**Duration:** Aug 2023 - Sep 2023

This project entailed the development of a versatile natural language text generator, leading to significant advancements in automated content creation. Highlights include:

1. **Model Accuracy and Innovation:** By training on datasets exceeding 10k entries, we achieved over 93% accuracy in next-word prediction using Bare-Bones Markov and POS Hidden Markov models, alongside sophisticated techniques for enhanced performance.

### Airbnb Price Generator, Duke University
**Duration:** Aug 2023 - Sep 2023

The Airbnb Price Generator project involved creating an R Model to accurately forecast future pricing for hosts. Key achievements were:

1. **Model Precision:** Developed a multilinear regression model, trained on an extensive dataset of 3,239 observations and 75 variables, which included critical market influencers like user reviews and facility standards, resulting in a RMSE lower than 0.4.
   
2. **Efficiency and Accuracy Enhancements:** Improved the model's performance by over 30% through the application of advanced data science tools, including tidyverse, caret, metrics, and DataExplorer.
